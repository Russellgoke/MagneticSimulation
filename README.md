There is a magnetic field interaction and exchange energy interaction, we can model both
The energy is either in the lattice or the spins. If the spins align the energy enters the lattice and 
increases the temperature, do we want other types of energy maybe phonons or other.


Speedups:
add some threads but has to be multiple trials or else the GIL will ruin it up to 7X
make it always accept a flip with different probabilities 1.5-2X
switch to c++ 3X, more with threading
effectvie fireld becomes array of arrays I think
